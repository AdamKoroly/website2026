        Hi, I’m Adam — an economics student at IE University with a strong interest in analytics, markets, and the stories data can tell about how people and businesses make decisions. 
        I’m drawn to work that sits at the intersection of numbers and strategy: turning messy information into clear insights, building frameworks for decision-making, and communicating results in a way that helps others act with confidence. Whether I’m analyzing financial statements, exploring macroeconomic trends, or working with datasets to spot patterns, I enjoy the process of asking good questions, testing assumptions, and refining an answer until it’s both accurate and useful.

        A defining experience for me was spending time in the United States, which pushed me to grow both personally and professionally. 
        Being in a new environment challenged my comfort zone, strengthened my independence, and broadened the way I think about opportunity, competitiveness, and global perspectives in finance and economics. 
        It also reinforced something I value deeply: learning through experience. I came back more motivated to build skills that travel well — quantitative thinking, structured problem-solving, and the ability to adapt quickly.

        My goals are centered around becoming a strong analyst who can combine economic intuition with practical financial tools. 
        In the near term, I’m focused on sharpening my technical foundation — especially in financial modeling, valuation, statistics/econometrics, 
        and data analytics — while continuing to build a portfolio of projects that reflect real-world thinking. Longer term, I want to work in a role where I can contribute to high-quality analysis, 
        support smarter decisions, and keep expanding my understanding of markets and the economy. 
        I’m especially interested in paths like investment analysis, corporate finance, economic research, or data-driven strategy — anywhere rigorous thinking and clear communication make a measurable impact.
      </p>

        This portfolio is a snapshot of that journey. You’ll find projects and experiences that highlight how I approach problems: with curiosity, structure, and a focus on results. 
        If you’d like to connect, collaborate, or discuss opportunities, feel free to reach out — I’m always open to conversations that challenge me to learn more and grow faster.
      </p>
