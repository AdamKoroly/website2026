    Now that the worlds most powerful people left Davos, I can finally confidently write about. In this artice there is one particullar speach that 
    I would like to discuss and that was given by "daddy" ask Donald Trump referred to himself. After I had the pleasure of listening to Trumps for 70 
    minutes, I narrowed down the possibilities of senerios. First, this guy doesn't know what is going on and lives in his own universe where ha can
    do whatever he want's to do. Just to give you some example: tariffs, ICE, Greenland, almost crashing the economy, calling woman "piggy" and more.
    The second senerio is that he simply just doesn't care. His only goal with presidency is to make himslef and his friends richer, by stealing from poor.
    He is like a reversed Robin Hood. His speach was as boring as possible and I think that he finally realized the fact that, 
    the bullshit that he is feeding the americans people might be beliveble for americans, but not in Europe.

    For me Macrons glasses stole the show for sure. It was good to see that european and institutional leaders finally have the balls to step
    up agains Trump. Even Jamie Dimon said "I don't like what I'm seeing", so it was good to see that finally institutional leaders are more
    open about their opinion and less scared about Trump suing them. Oh, but for the record, after this comment Trump did infact sue Jamie, 
    but honestly what do you expect?
