    First of all, what did we expect? WE - the hungarian people - where promised 3-6 % GDP growth. Now honestly I don't think that anyone with
    a BA in any economics related field belived that these numbers can be achieved. Of course the is an election comming up in April so
    every single politician is selling the dream that if they get elected then the economcy will boom.
